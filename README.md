# gpr_isotropy

A simple library to manage GPR-based inferences of anisotropies (small perturbations based on a "well fit" model).

## To Do

  * write `sample-gps_isotropy` and confirm that it reproduces marginal distribution for Ro correctly
  * extend infrastructure so that Ro and eps can have different numbers of pixels (eps >= Ro always?)
  * extend infrastructure so that Ro can be represented by spherical harmonics
  * extend infrastructure to support arbitrary gridding (at least for eps?)
